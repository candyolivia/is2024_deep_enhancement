Subject: BEEP version 1.0 released
--text follows this line--
BEEP (British English Example Pronunciations) version 1.0 has now been
released.

There are two main changes from the last version (0.7 of 7 Aug 1996):

  1) The primary and secondary stress markings have been removed (they
     were both incomplete and inconsistent).

  2) I've added a file "case.txt" which lists the probable mixture of
     upper and lower case letters for the most common words in the main
     dictionary.  The words in the main dictionary remain in upper case
     for reasons of coverage and backwards compatibility.

It is available by FTP from:

  ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/dictionaries/beep.tar.gz
